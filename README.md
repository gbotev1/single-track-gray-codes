## Abstract
Gray codes are sequences of binary codewords with numerous applications in telecommunications,
 robotics, error correction, combinatorics, and graph theory. Single-track Gray
 codes are a subclass of Gray codes that can be specied by a single binary
 vector. These codes can be constructed from a seed code, which becomes
 computationally difficult to generate for bit-lengths greater than 37. A
 general construction for single-track Gray codes is introduced, and the
 resulting codes yield a full-period code with 2^n distinct codewords. Unevenly
 spaced sensors and logical bitwise operators were utilized to make decoding
 efficient.
